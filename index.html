        <p class="para">I like to play video games because they are a good source of entertainment for me. However, they can make you feel emotion as well. Some might be relaxing, and others might be intense. A few might be scary, and lots of them make you feel multiple emotions at different times. I can also play with my friends, and it can be very suprising sometimes. Something truly magnificent about video games is that if you know how to, you can create just about anything. And even as a player, you can still do the same. You can create awesome buildings, explore new places, pretty much whatever you want to do. The potential you can release in video games, is why I like them.
